// Records the indent "step" each line introduces relative to its
// predecessor, rather than the absolute leading width. The motivation
// is that a deeply nested 4-space file would otherwise be dominated by
// the 8-space (level 2) lines that outnumber the 4-space (level 1)
// ones — making the file look like an "8-space" file when it isn't.
// A relative diff records the step itself, so any block transition
// (0→4, 4→8, 8→4, etc.) contributes the same key 4.
//
// Keys:
//   - "tab"   when the current line starts with a tab.
//   - <number> when both the current and the previous line are
//             space-leading (or column 0) and the diff is > 0.
// Skipped lines (blank lines, JSDoc / block-comment continuation
// lines whose first non-space character is `*`) leave the "previous
// line" state untouched, so a comment block doesn't introduce a
// spurious diff against the code on either side of it. The first
// recorded line just sets the baseline; it contributes no key.
//
// A `primaryIndentWidth` helper picks the most-frequent key out of the
// resulting map for callers (the report aggregator, the action's
// rewrite unit).
