// Report router. Validates argv-side input against the report-name
// registry (kept in ./report-names.ts so it can be imported without
// dragging in ts-morph) and runs requested reports in a fixed order.
// Each report function returns the action params its recommendation
// would drive (or an empty partial when nothing strict was found); the
// router merges those into a single TsSurveyReport so a caller can
// chain them into action calls (or render them via report --output).
