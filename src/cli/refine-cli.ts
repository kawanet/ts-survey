// refineCLI is the whole CLI as a function: consume the leading global options
// up to the subcommand, then hand the remaining tokens to the matching command
// handler in COMMAND_TABLE. Each handler parses its own options (calling
// parseCommonArgs for any trailing globals), opens the project, and runs.
// refineCLI writes stdout-bound output stream and resolves with 0 on
// success; on failure it rejects with an Error for the caller to display and
// turn into a non-zero exit. It never calls process.exit.
//
// Per-command progress and diagnostics go to `ctx.log` (the entry point wires
// it to stderr); the library never writes to the console itself.
